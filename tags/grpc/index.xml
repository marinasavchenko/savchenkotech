      <description>Communication protocols play essential role in every modern software system. With increasing popularity of Microservice architecture inter-process communication techniques become even more important.
The most common way to build request-response style communication is RESTful services. However, REST can be inefficient and error-prone to use in microservices. We would need something more scalable, loosely coupled and efficient. That is where gRPC will shine.
 gRPC (the “g” stands for something different in every gRPC release) is an inter-process communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke, operate, and debug distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call.</description>
