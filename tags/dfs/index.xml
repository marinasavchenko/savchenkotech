      <description>Graph algorithms solve many problems in computer science and are fundamental to the field. Depth First Search (DFS) is one of them.
Representation of a graph Before we dive into DFS we need to understand Graph structure and terminology.
Graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices.
Examples of a Graph would be:
 in finance : Currency is a vertex, transaction is an edge in transportation : Street intersection is a vertex, route is an edge  Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 2 when there is an edge between them.</description>
