      <description>If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.&#xA;Isaac Newton&#xA;Programming is not about coding it is about working with people. Sounds easy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? You put people in one room, and somehow it all should magically work out.&#xA;The problem is that most people do not even come across as they intend to. I am not even talking about solving complex issues.</description>
