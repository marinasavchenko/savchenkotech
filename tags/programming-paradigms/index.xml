      <description>Programming paradigms are ways of programming that are reflected in language features. They tell us which structures to use and when to use them.
There are 3 such main paradigms:
  structured programming
  object-orient programming
  functional programming.
  Most languages are multi-paradigm but levels of restrictions/enforcing can be different. For example, both Java and Scala support object-orient and functional programming. At the same time level of enforcement of the functional paradigm in Scala is much higher.</description>
