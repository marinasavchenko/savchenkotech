      <description>Since Alan Turing time we came from running one program at a time on bare metal to running millions of java virtual threads. Which is absolutely impressive.
Why? Why should we care about threads at all? The answer is - performance. Applying concurrency can improve performance through reducing (process one task faster) or hiding latency (process another task while waiting) or increasing throughput (process more tasks).
Current java concurrency implementation is based on the rule that one Java thread equals exactly one OS thread (one-to-one mapping).</description>

      <description>To reduce duplication (boilerplate) in code pattern matching with if statements and the instanceof operator was introduced with Java version 16.
 Pattern matching is a technique of controlling program flow that only executes a section of code that meets certain criteria.
 Pattern matching with if and instanceOf In code example without pattern matching cast is needed.
 public Integer objectToString(Object object) {  if (object instanceof String) {  String string = (String) object;  return Integer.</description>
