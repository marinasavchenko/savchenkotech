      <description>Current java concurrency implementation is based on the rule that one Java thread equals exactly one OS thread (one-to-one mapping). This means that every Thread.start() creates a new OS thread.
Modern high-performance JVM applications are expected to handle tens of thousands concurrent connections. And thread-per-connection architecture fails in this case.
So, there are 2 main disadvantages to the current model used in Java:
 threads are expensive to create threads limit can be reached very easily.</description>

      <description>Pattern matching is a technique of controlling program flow that only executes a section of code that meets certain criteria. It helps to reduce boilerplate (code that duplicates over and over again) in code.
Pattern matching with if and instanceOf In code example without pattern matching cast is needed.
 public Integer objectToString(Object object) {  if (object instanceof String) {  String string = (String) object;  return Integer.parseInt(string);  }  if (object instanceof Integer) {  return (Integer) object;  }  return 0;  }  With pattern matching we get immediate cast.</description>
