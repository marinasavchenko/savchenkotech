      <description>Mistakes&amp;hellip;Why am I talking about them? The answer is - Kotlin documentation. To be more precise, me stumbling into Tony Hoare being referenced in the Kotlin documentation for the development of Null reference. Later I found the same reference in an article about error handling. When I googled it, I found many more places that mentioned so-called &amp;ldquo;billion-dollar mistake&amp;rdquo;: articles, pictures of the mountains with a quote (as if it is supposed to be an inspiration), even conference talk.</description>

      <description>Effective public speaking is a crucial to your personal, professional and social success. At the same time many developers luck the confidence to communicate clearly, which leads to missing out on career opportunities.

      <description>If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.
Isaac Newton
 Programming is not about coding it is about working with people. Sounds easy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? You put people in one room, and somehow it all should magically work out.
The problem is that most people do not even come across as they intend to. I am not even talking about solving complex issues.</description>
