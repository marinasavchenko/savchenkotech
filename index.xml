      <description>This article is describing how to create gRPC service implementation using Spring Boot. To achieve that you need to complete 3 tasks:
 Create module for proto model and service definitions. Create module with server side implementation of gRPC. Test service with BloomRPC.  1. Generation of Proto model and service definition It will be Maven project. So, first you need to add all necessary dependencies to pom.xml. For generating java source files from .</description>

      <description>Effective public speaking is a crucial to your personal, professional and social success. At the same time many developers luck the confidence to communicate clearly, which leads to missing out on career opportunities.
The biggest threat to our confidence is anxiety, in other words - being nervous. Anxiety - is a signal that we are doing something important. So you can not get rid of it completely. But we do not want anxiety to prevent us from being ourselves and let our skills shine.</description>

      <title>Is gRPC a better choice over REST?</title>
      <link>https://savchenko.tech/posts/grpcvsrest/</link>

      <description>Communication protocols play essential role in every modern software system. With increasing popularity of Microservice architecture inter-process communication techniques become even more important.
The most common way to build request-response style communication is RESTful services. However, REST can be inefficient and error-prone to use in microservices. We would need something more scalable, loosely coupled and efficient. That is where gRPC will shine.
 gRPC (the “g” stands for something different in every gRPC release) is an inter-process communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke, operate, and debug distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call.</description>

      <title>Team framework - my view on team collaboration</title>

      <description>Team framework is an established set of practices that creates a solid base for an effective collaboration. It is the way to productivity and happiness of each team member.
This set of practices should solve next problems:
 Prioritizing values Resolving competing values (for example, excellence vs pragmatism, flexibility vs predictability) Resolving conflicting views (for example, what to test and on which level) Reducing time on discussing how things need to be done  I see Extreme programming as a perfect starting point for team framework.</description>

      <title>Once again about the testing</title>

      <description>Effective software testing should minimize the amount of defects and maximize stability of the product. Achieving it in practice can be quite effortful. What to test? How many test cases? Who should test?
Questions what to test and on which level can be answered by testing pyramid.
1. Unit testing Unit testing is a type of testing where system under test is an individual unit and is done during the coding phase.</description>

      <description>Learning is the crucial tool on the road to mastery and true driver of the software craftsman career.
I believe that effective learning contains of components so called learning framework. This framework can be applied to any kind of learning. It does not meter if it is learning the language or preparing for the OCP (Oracle Certified Professional) exam.
So, what are those components?
1. Reflect Analyzing what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t can make any learning path much easier.</description>
