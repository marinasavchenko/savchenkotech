This set of practices should solve next problems:
 Prioritizing values Resolving competing values (for example, excellence vs pragmatism, flexibility vs predictability) Resolving conflicting views (for example, what to test and on which level) Reducing time on discussing how things need to be done  I see Extreme programming as a perfect starting point for team framework.</description>

      <description>Learning is the crucial tool on the road to mastery and true driver of the software craftsman career.
I believe that effective learning contains of components so called learning framework. This framework can be applied to any kind of learning. It does not meter if it is learning the language or preparing for the OCP (Oracle Certified Professional) exam.
