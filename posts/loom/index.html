      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Since Alan Turing time we came from running one program at a time on bare metal to running millions of java virtual threads.
Which is absolutely impressive.</p>
<p>Why? Why should we care about threads at all?
The answer is - performance.
Applying concurrency can improve performance in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing latency (process one task faster)</li>
<li>hiding latency (process another task while waiting)</li>
<li>increasing throughput (process more tasks).</li>
</ul>
<p>Current java concurrency implementation is based on the rule that one Java thread equals exactly one OS thread (one-to-one mapping).
This means that every <code>Thread.start()</code> creates a new OS thread.</p>
<p>Modern high-performance JVM applications are expected to handle tens of thousands concurrent connections.
And thread-per-connection architecture fails in this case.</p>
<p>So, there are 2 main disadvantages to the current model used in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>threads are expensive to create</li>
<li>threads limit can be reached very easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Project Loom is tackling this disadvantages.
The goal of Project loom is to enable easy-to-use, high-throughput lightweight concurrency and new programming models on the Java platform.
It will be done by removing involvement of the OS in the lifecycle of a virtual thread.
So, large-scale JVM applications will not be restricted to a few thousand OS threads.</p>
<h3 id="some-terminology">Some terminology</h3>
<p>Loom introduces next new constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual threads</li>
<li>Continuations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual thread</strong> is an implementation of threads provided by the Java runtime.
They are not one-to-one wrappers over OS threads.</p>
<p>Virtual thread has 2 components: continuation and scheduler.</p>
<p>A <strong>continuation</strong> is a sequence of instructions that execute sequentially, and may suspend itself.</p>
<p>A <strong>scheduler</strong> assigns continuations to CPU cores, replacing a paused one with another that&rsquo;s ready to run,
and ensuring that a continuation that is ready to resume will eventually be assigned to a CPU core.</p>
<p>A <strong>carrier thread</strong> is an OS thread that on which a virtual thread executes.
Over its lifetime, a single virtual thread may run on several different carrier threads.</p>
<h3 id="creating-virtual-threads">Creating virtual threads</h3>
<p>New syntax is not differ much from already existing threads functionality. This should not complicate adjusting of
an existing code.</p>
<p>New method is added for creating executor service. It creates 1 virtual thread per task.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ExecutorService executorService <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Executors.<span style="color:#a6e22e">newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor</span>();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And there is a builder on Thread class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Thread.<span style="color:#a6e22e">builder</span>().<span style="color:#a6e22e">virtual</span>().<span style="color:#a6e22e">task</span>(r).<span style="color:#a6e22e">build</span>();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, I am reading &ldquo;Java concurrency in practice&rdquo;&hellip; and hoping that Loom will be released with Java 19 this fall.</p>
