<p>Programming is not about coding it is about working with people. Sounds easy, isn&rsquo;t it?
You put people in one room, and somehow it all should magically work out.<br>
The problem is that most people do not even come across as they intend to. I am not even talking about solving complex issues.
So, effective collaboration takes time and effort.</p>
<p>To be productive we should and have to stand on shoulders of others not only technology-wise but also communication-wise.
And team framework could be a great assistance here.</p>
<p>Team framework is an established set of practices that creates a solid base for an effective collaboration.
It is the way to productivity and happiness of each team member.</p>
<p>This set of practices should solve next problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing values</li>
<li>Resolving competing values (for example, excellence vs pragmatism, flexibility vs predictability)</li>
<li>Resolving conflicting views (for example, what to test and on which level)</li>
<li>Reducing time on discussing how things need to be done</li>
</ul>
<p>I see Extreme programming as a perfect starting point for team framework. Although it has never got the popularity it deserves,
parts of the methodology can and should be applied.</p>
<p>A philosophy of this methodology is based on the values of communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Communication is crucial for creating a sense of team and effective cooperation.
Clear, honest communication relieves tension and improves credibility.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>Improving communication helps achieve simplicity by eliminating unneeded or deferrable requirements from today’s concerns.
Achieving simplicity gives you that much less to communicate about.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback is a critical part of communication.
At the same time, the simpler the system, the easier it is to get feedback about it.</p>
<h3 id="courage">Courage</h3>
<p>The courage is another crucial value that touches all areas of the software development process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The courage to speak truths, pleasant or unpleasant, fosters communication and trust.</li>
<li>The courage to discard failing solutions and seek new ones encourages simplicity.</li>
<li>The courage to seek real, concrete answers creates feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>
<p>For software development to simultaneously improve in humanity and productivity,
the contributions of each person in the team need to be respected.
&ldquo;I am important and so are you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Application of the values in day-to-day life is done through the practices.
And practices don&rsquo;t make sense without the values which backing them up.</p>
<p>Here are the most important practices:</p>
<h4 id="1-the-whole-team">1. The whole team</h4>
<p>People need a sense of “team”:</p>
<ul>
<li>We belong.</li>
<li>We are in this together.</li>
<li>We support each other&rsquo;s work, growth, and learning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-energized-work">2. Energized Work</h4>
<p>When you’re sick, respect yourself and the rest of your team by resting and getting well.
Taking care of yourself is the quickest way back to energized work.</p>
<h4 id="3-pair-programming">3. Pair Programming</h4>
<p>Pair programming is a dialog between two people simultaneously programming (and analyzing and designing and testing)
and trying to program better.</p>
<p>Pair programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep each other on task.</li>
<li>Brainstorm refinements to the system.</li>
<li>Clarify ideas.</li>
<li>Take initiative when their partner is stuck, thus lowering frustration.</li>
<li>Hold each other accountable to the team’s practices.</li>
<li>Share  knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-test-first-programming">4. Test-First Programming</h4>
<p>Writing a failing automated test before changing any code has next benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>focusing on one piece of code (business logic)</li>
<li>producing loosely coupled, highly cohesive code</li>
<li>gaining trust of teammates</li>
<li>achieving clearness and effectiveness (code, refactor, test, code, refactor)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-incremental-design">5. Incremental Design</h4>
<p>Design that is done close to when it is used is more efficient.
As your expertise grows in making changes to a running system in small, safe steps,
you can afford to defer more and more of the design investment.</p>
<p>I truly believe that having this kind of framework will make software development more enjoyable and effective.</p>
